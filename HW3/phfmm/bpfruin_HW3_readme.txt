Homework 3

Java

The code is commented in the .java files to briefly explain methods.

The implementation of this program could be improved significantly but I've been working on it for days and am running out of time.  I don't think I properly implemented the facade pattern.  I probably should have used facade classes but again, I ran out of time.

I'm not sure if my testing is sufficient.  I have code to execute the 3 recipes in the main class, the paths just need to be commented/uncommented.  They call methods on the UI, which call methods on the control layer that in turn call methods on the hardware layer.

I was confused as to what to do for the starting and stopping of the machine.  Both of those events seemed automatic and triggered by other methods so I did not really understand how we were supposed to decouple those events.

I had a number of other issues I wanted to address here but now they're just a nebulous cloud of words in my head.  Hopefully I did an ok job on this assignment and improved from HW2.
